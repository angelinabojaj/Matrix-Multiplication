# Parallel Matrix Multiplication Project 

This project explores and compares matrix multiplication using three methods:
- Serial (baseline)
- OpenMP (CPU parallelism)
- CUDA (GPU parallelism)

 ## Contributors
- Mirna
- Angelina
- Haya
- Halee

## Description
Implement using multiple matrix sizes for each method.
Compare execution time, analyze results, find advantages and limitations of each.
this is a group project for CSI 4650 course Semester: Winter 2025
